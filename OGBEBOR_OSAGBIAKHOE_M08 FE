# Goal: To input a list of employee names and salaries, calculate various statistics, and display the results.
# Variables:
# - employee_names (list): Stores the names of employees.
# - employee_salaries (list): Stores the salaries of employees.
# - total_salary (float): Accumulates the total salary of all employees.
# - highest_salary (float): Stores the highest salary found.
# - lowest_salary (float): Stores the lowest salary found.
# - average_salary (float): Stores the average salary.
# - count (int): Keeps track of the number of employees.
# - sentinel (str): The sentinel value used to end input.

# Initialize lists to store employee names and salaries
employee_names = []
employee_salaries = []

# Initialize variables for calculations
total_salary = 0.0
highest_salary = float('-inf')  # Initialize with negative infinity for comparison
lowest_salary = float('inf')    # Initialize with positive infinity for comparison
average_salary = 0.0
count = 0

# Define the sentinel value to end input
sentinel = "done"

# Input loop to collect employee names and salaries
while True:
    name = input("Enter employee name (or 'done' to finish): ")
    
    if name.lower() == sentinel:
        break
    
    salary = float(input("Enter employee salary (in even hundreds): "))
    
    # Add the name and salary to the respective lists
    employee_names.append(name)
    employee_salaries.append(salary)
    
    # Update total salary and check for highest/lowest salaries
    total_salary += salary
    highest_salary = max(highest_salary, salary)
    lowest_salary = min(lowest_salary, salary)
    count += 1

# Calculate the average salary
average_salary = total_salary / count if count > 0 else 0.0

# Display employee names and salaries
print("\nEmployee Names and Salaries:")
for i in range(count):
    print(f"{employee_names[i]}: ${employee_salaries[i]:,.2f}")

# Display average, highest, and lowest salaries
print("\nStatistics:")
print(f"Average Salary: ${average_salary:,.2f}")
print(f"Highest Salary: ${highest_salary:,.2f}")
print(f"Lowest Salary: ${lowest_salary:,.2f}")

# Display employees within a $5,000 range of the average salary
print("\nEmployees within $5,000 range of the average:")
for i in range(count):
    if abs(employee_salaries[i] - average_salary) <= 5000:
        print(f"{employee_names[i]}: ${employee_salaries[i]:,.2f}")
