# Name of the submission: Trainers/enrollees
# Author of the submission: [Osagbiakhoe Ogbebor]
# Summary/goal of the submission: This program allows the manager of Wally's Training Gym to track and categorize trainers based on the number of new members they have enrolled.

# Initialize arrays to store trainer names and their corresponding enrollments
trainer_names = []
enrollments = []

# Define constants for enrollment categories
CATEGORY_1 = (0, 5)
CATEGORY_2 = (6, 10)
CATEGORY_3 = (11, 15)

# Initialize counters for each category
count_category_1 = 0
count_category_2 = 0
count_category_3 = 0

# Prompt the user to enter trainer names and enrollments
for i in range(15):  # You can change the number of trainers as needed
    trainer_name = input(f"Enter the last name of Trainer {i + 1}: ")
    new_enrollments = int(input(f"Enter the number of new enrollments for {trainer_name}: "))
    
    # Append trainer name and enrollments to the respective arrays
    trainer_names.append(trainer_name)
    enrollments.append(new_enrollments)
    
    # Categorize trainers based on their enrollments
    if CATEGORY_1[0] <= new_enrollments <= CATEGORY_1[1]:
        count_category_1 += 1
    elif CATEGORY_2[0] <= new_enrollments <= CATEGORY_2[1]:
        count_category_2 += 1
    elif CATEGORY_3[0] <= new_enrollments <= CATEGORY_3[1]:
        count_category_3 += 1

# Display the results
print("\nTrainers categorized by the number of new enrollments:")
print(f"0-5 Enrollments: {count_category_1} trainers")
print(f"6-10 Enrollments: {count_category_2} trainers")
print(f"11-15 Enrollments: {count_category_3} trainers")
